		<p class="bodytext"><span id="madtext">Who I Am</span><br /><br />My name's Pete, friends call me 'Ard Pete... or at least they used to! I've softened up over the years.<br /><br />
		I'm 32 years old (and not getting any younger!) living in the back streets of Sheffield, the other half says it's not rough here, but it definitely is!<br /><br />
		I currently work in IT as an application tester and trainer, much different than the other roles I've had in IT over the last five years and working in IT for the last five years I've come to the realisation that it's not what I want to do forever.<br /><br />
		Ever since I can remember, all the way back to primary school my one aspiration in life was to be a website designer. I loved the idea of creating beautiful websites but I never got the opportunities to make this happen, I did IT in college for a couple of years then ended up working dead end jobs in factories.<br /><br />
		Eventually I made it to customer service roles and then onto IT roles where I continually expanded my knowledge through self-training and helpful friends. Now I'm finally in a position to try and train myself in becoming a full stack developer, I don't think I realized how much of a daunting task I had set myself until I truly started doing it.<br /><br />
		This website is the result of a month of learning, practising, screwing up, starting over, trying, trying, trying. I now know it's going to take me a very long time to be where I want to be but for the first time in my life I'm excited to start a journey and it's a journey that I want to finish, the finish line being a software developer and website designer.<br /><br /><br />
		Outside of work and learning; I'm a geek at heart. I enjoy a wide variety of television shows, films, music. MMA and wrestling are probably the only sports I watch.<br /><br />
		I listen to audiobooks on my way to work, I love food, I'm overweight, I'm addicted to caffiene and nicotine, I love writing and gaming (Rocket League in particular) however all my spare time is now spent doing this.<br /><br />
		And lastly, but definitely not least I have a beautiful, loving and supportive family (pictured), Lucie the love of my life and my two step children Evie and Jamie. I've always wanted to be the person that can provide for his family and have them want for nothing and that is my biggest drive to do this of all.<br /><br />
		Considering a month ago I knew nothing about coding and have minimal HTML knowledge, I don't think I'm doing too badly. Now I kind of have my head around HTML and CSS the next step is learning Java and JQuery, the first steps in becoming a developer.<br /><br />
